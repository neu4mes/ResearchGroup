:::{#about}


I am a PhD researcher in autonomous systems focusing on real-time motion
planning and control for autonomous racing. My work combines model-based
approaches and learning-based methods, with a strong emphasis on full-system
integration and practical validation in simulation and on real platforms. I am
particularly interested in building complete, real-time software systems that
connect theory with experimental results.
