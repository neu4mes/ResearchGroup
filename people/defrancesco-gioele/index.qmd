:::{#about}

I received my MSc degree in Mechatronics Engineering, with a focus on Intelligent Vehicles, from the University of Trento, Italy. I am currently a Ph.D. student, and my research focuses on the integration of neural networks into vehicle modelling and control. My main research interests include vehicle dynamics and autonomous driving systems.
