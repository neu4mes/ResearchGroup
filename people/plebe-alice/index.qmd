:::{#about}

I’m an assistant professor (RTDa) at the University of Trento, where I study how insights from nature can inspire the design of neural networks. My current research explores models informed and constrained by physical principles. Earlier in my career, I looked to human cognition for inspiration, developing autonomous driving agents and perception systems that used brain-like mechanisms and mental imagery to anticipate unforeseen scenarios.

From 2024 to 2025, I was a research fellow in the Department of Computer Science at University College London, where I studied how large language models can reason like and collaborate with humans. My work there focused on LLMs in multi-agent systems and the role of trust in shaping effective collaboration between agents. I also examined how vision–language models mirror human biases, particularly in the spread of misinformation.

In 2020, I was a visiting researcher at the Cognitive Robotics Lab at TU Delft, where I investigated how cognitive architectures can inform the design of neural networks for perception systems in autonomous vehicles.

Beyond research, I explore the creative side of technology through 3D computer graphics, video game development, and architectural design. These pursuits often inspire fresh perspectives on my technical work.
